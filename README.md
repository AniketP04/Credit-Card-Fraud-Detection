# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection using Keras Autoencoders
This project is used to detect a credit card fraud detection in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder- based. an autoencoder with two hidden layer clustering model is build. an autoencoder with two hidden layer and K-means clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm is used. The data has been taken from Kaggle.


# Credit Card Fraud detction using Autoencoders in [H2O](https://h2o.ai/)
Machine Learning PLatform used in here is H2O, which is a Fast, Scalable, Open source application for machine/deep learning.The speciality of H2O is that it is using in-memory compression to handles billions of data rows in memory, even in a small cluster. It is easy to use APIs with R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON as well as a built in web interface. For using H2O framework, first install [Java Kit](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/).
